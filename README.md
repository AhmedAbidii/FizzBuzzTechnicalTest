# FizzBuzz Technical Test

Hello, thank you for reviewing my technical test. 
I only used domain and presentation layers. I didn't want to overengineer the application (Manual DI) but I wanted to use the best practices.

## Improvements

1. Add validators for user input
2. Add paging (load more on scroll) and limit to the items shown in the list
3. Move calculations to a background thread
4. Add Loading state when calculating the result
